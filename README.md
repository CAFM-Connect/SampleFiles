Sample files for CAFM-Connect

In this repository, we collect sample files, based on the CAFM-Connect system. These sample files can be used to 

* illustrate usage scenarios of CAFM-Connect
* give developers an easy access to implementation samples
* certify software implementations of CAFM-Connect
* discuss about open questions within the developer community
* and much more.
